## Console Logging

During testing, open browser console to verify these log messages appear:

### When Saving:
- `ðŸ”– [OptimizedPostCard] Dispatching item-saved event...`
- `ðŸ“Œ [ListsView] Item saved event received...`
- `ðŸ”– [MainScreen] Item saved event...`

### When Unsaving:
- `ðŸ“Œ [ListsView] Item unsaved event received...`
- `ðŸ”– [MainScreen] Item unsaved event...`

### When Deleting:
- `ðŸ”” [ListsView] Dispatching unsave event for post...`
- `ðŸ”– [MainScreen] Item deleted event...`
- `ðŸ”„ [OptimizedPostCard] Saved item deleted, removing bookmark...`

## Edge Cases to Test

1. **Offline Mode**: Try saving/unsaving while offline
2. **Network Latency**: Test with slow network (Chrome DevTools Network throttling)
3. **Concurrent Updates**: Have two tabs open, save in one, verify it appears in the other
4. **App Resume**: Background the app, save an item, resume app, verify state is correct

## Success Criteria

âœ… All saved items appear immediately without refresh
âœ… All saved items are clickable immediately  
âœ… Bookmark states sync correctly between Feed and Lists
âœ… No duplicate items in Saved Items list
âœ… No "stuck" bookmark states requiring refresh
