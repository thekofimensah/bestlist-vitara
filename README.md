The upload-update.js script will automatically create and update the version.json in Supabase storage based on your package.json version.
The flow is:

Update version in `package.json`
Run `npm run upload-update`
Script automatically updates version.json in Supabase storage

Changes to front end code:  npm run build &&  npx cap sync android 
Here's a comprehensive list of files and the corresponding commands needed when they change:

1. `npm install` needed when changing:
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`
   - Any `.js`/`.ts` files
   - Any `.jsx`/`.tsx` files
   - Any `.css`/`.scss` files
   - Any web assets (images, fonts, etc.)
   - `src/` directory files
   - `public/` directory files

2. `npx cap update android` needed when changing:
   - `capacitor.config.ts`
   - `package.json` (after npm install)
   - Any web assets that need to be copied to Android
   - `src/` directory files (after npm install)
   - `public/` directory files (after npm install)
   - `android/capacitor.config.json`
   - `android/app/src/main/assets/public/` directory

3. `./gradlew build` needed when changing:
   - `android/build.gradle`
   - `android/app/build.gradle`
   - `android/gradle.properties`
   - `android/settings.gradle`
   - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - `android/app/src/main/java/` files
   - `android/app/src/main/kotlin/` files
   - `android/app/src/main/res/` files
   - Any `.gradle` files
   - `android/app/src/main/assets/` (non-public assets)

4. `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` needed when:
   - `./gradlew build` fails
   - You get strange build errors
   - You change Android SDK versions
   - You modify native Android code
   - You need to clear build cache

Common workflow patterns:
1. Web changes:
   ```
   Change web files → npm install → npx cap update android
   ```

2. Android changes:
   ```
   Change Android files → ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Build issues:
   ```
   Build fails → ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
   ```

4. Full update:
   ```
   Change web files → npm install → npx cap update android → ./gradlew build
   ```

Remember:
- Always run `npm install` before `npx cap update android` if you changed web files
- Always run `npx cap update android` before `./gradlew build` if you changed web files
- Use `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` as a last resort when builds fail


npm run build && npx cap sync android


To do:

///////////////////////////

Clean up items' details section

    All the following fields should be easy to edit or remove. All will be autogenerated by AI  
      - Name (only edit, is required field). AI should fill in the name of the product as well as what it is, 3 things: Brand, what it is, and any quantifiers (fat free, color, etc..) That's what the ai needs to fill out. 
      - Tags (can remove, add tags, no edit: when ai/user creates a new tag, this tag should save somewhere so that when they want to add tags, it will show all tags they've created, ordered by the amount of lists that use that tag)
      - Location (default should save GPS coordinates of device, but should be seen as City, Country -- later I want to create a map)
      
   
   Add AI function 
      A little (rate this autofill) with 3 options for feedback if they give a thumbs down: Completely wrong, a few things wrong, one thing wrong, took too long Write this out a bit cleaner language and friendly.

      The request for this should be sent in parallel with other processes, but while loading, should show a loading icon, if more than 4s, then it should indicate that the user needs to enter values themselves

      Log when user makes changes to any of the fields. I'm not sure the best way to log this, but saving the oriignal suggestion for each field and the final saved for each field. That only needs to be done when first writing, any edits after no need to track.

      If confidence is less than 70%, a small red message should appear informing the user that AI lookup failed, try retaking the picture for a better shot or something like that

      What's the smallest an image can be compressed for good read? Better to compress, make small or both?

   Add a prompt when they try and create an entry without any notes. It should say "Even a few words helps you remember why you loved this" and then they should have the option to contiune without notes, or go back and add a few words. There shuld also be a box to "Don't show again". There should also be a way to visually make the notes section look more important and not optional. 
  
List view
   This view needs to be thought of a bit more, but for this draft, 2 columns view, sorting the most recently added to first. Make it look like pinterest The most recently added to should also be the default for the lists view inside of the bulkimport or additem. 

ShowItemsInlistview
   This view needs to be thought of a bit more, but I think it should show like a shopping cart view, where the image is smaller, then next to it is the title and notes. The # of stars should not be shown in this view, but rather there should be distinct sections for each star group (all 5 stars grouped, 4 stars, etc..). There should be a little edit and delete button for each entry, and if you click on an entry, a popup should show a larger image with all the metadata and an edit button as well. The deafult sorting for each group is two fold first by stars, then date within each star category. So if the user clicks on one, it should just make it a bit bigger so they can see the image and other fields, not for editing. IF they do a long click, then it's to delete. 
   
   Show an options three dots button which will allow the following: change view and order within groups. The view should be the list option that we do by default or grid option. Grid option is what it currently is at. They should also change the sort order within groups to be by newest, oldest or alphebetical.

   Product card should show easy to read date and time.

Profile view 
   Add button for contact support/ give feedback

Add cache for lists locally -- every time referesh hapens update teh cache -- tried and failed, couldn't get it to work. Need to add backend apparently

Add logging for durations for page loads, imports and AI -- because supabase may not be good for logs, you can save it in a pretty raw and easy form to store in supabase and then I cna pull somewhere else if needed.

First time flow: a sliding in pop up should say "Welcome to ___" (next) "So many choices, so many products, but now you can finally save and share the best ones!" (next) "Let's create your first memory list where we'll save your images" (Name <The best....>, Decript (optional), next) "Now take a snap and never forget your faves!"

Also, delete?
  const handleRemovePhoto = (index) => {
    setSelectedPhotos(prev => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
    setPhotoStates(prev => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
    if (currentPhotoIndex >= index && currentPhotoIndex > 0) {
      setCurrentPhotoIndex(prev => prev - 1);
    }
  };
