# Performance Optimization Checklist

## üéØ Current Focus: Profile Stats Architecture Migration

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified performance issues with current `useUserStats.js` (3-4 second queries)
- [x] Designed new `profile_stats` table architecture
- [x] Created SQL migration script (`sql/profile_stats_migration.sql`)
- [x] Created optimized `useUserStatsOptimized.js` hook
- [x] Identified manual `refreshStats()` calls to remove from `App.jsx`

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] **Fix App.jsx syntax error** (missing closing brace in search modal)
- [ ] **Run SQL migration** in Supabase to create `profile_stats` table and triggers
- [ ] **Replace old useUserStats.js** with optimized version
- [ ] **Remove manual refreshStats() calls** from App.jsx

### üìã Next Steps
- [ ] **Test the new architecture** - verify stats update automatically
- [ ] **Monitor performance** - confirm sub-second load times
- [ ] **Add real-time subscription** for instant updates
- [ ] **Clean up old code** - remove unused refresh functions

## üöÄ Previous Performance Issues Addressed

### ‚úÖ Image Storage Optimization
- [x] Created `lib/imageStorage.js` for centralized image compression
- [x] Implemented WebP compression (0.4MB max, 1280px max)
- [x] Added Supabase Storage integration with CDN
- [x] Created `SmartImage` component for intelligent loading
- [x] Updated all image components to use new system

### ‚úÖ Loading Screen Optimization
- [x] Implemented comprehensive preloading system
- [x] Added progress tracking for all data loading steps
- [x] Preload lists, feed, stats, achievements before showing app
- [x] Added timeout protection for loading operations

### ‚úÖ Achievement System
- [x] Implemented `usePendingAchievements` hook
- [x] Added `notified_at` column to `user_achievements` table
- [x] Created global achievement notifications
- [x] Added "First in World" achievement triggers
- [x] Implemented repeatable achievements with count tracking

### ‚úÖ Database Query Optimization
- [x] Fixed foreign key constraint issues
- [x] Optimized list loading queries
- [x] Added retry mechanisms for `PGRST002` errors
- [x] Implemented exponential backoff for failed queries

### ‚úÖ User Tracking
- [x] Created `useUserTracking` hook
- [x] Added session-based tracking to prevent duplicates
- [x] Implemented device info logging
- [x] Added app version tracking

## üêõ Known Issues to Fix

### High Priority
- [ ] **App.jsx syntax error** - Missing closing brace in search modal
- [ ] **Loading screen progress** - Steps not updating visually
- [ ] **Duplicate user tracking logs** - Session tracking not working properly

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Achievement notifications** - Timing and display issues
- [ ] **Image upload cleanup** - Orphaned files when user cancels
- [ ] **Feed loading performance** - Still slow with large datasets

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Search functionality** - Could be optimized with debouncing
- [ ] **Error handling** - Some error messages could be more user-friendly

## üìä Performance Metrics to Monitor

### Before Optimization
- Profile stats loading: 3-4 seconds
- Image upload: 10-30 seconds
- App initialization: 5-10 seconds
- List loading: 2-3 seconds

### Target After Optimization
- Profile stats loading: <100ms
- Image upload: <5 seconds
- App initialization: <2 seconds
- List loading: <1 second

## üîß Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Remove duplicate code in `useUserStats.js` (refreshStats function)
- [ ] Consolidate error handling patterns
- [ ] Add TypeScript for better type safety
- [ ] Improve test coverage

### Database
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add database monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Optimize remaining slow queries

### Architecture
- [ ] Consider implementing Redis for caching
- [ ] Add API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add performance monitoring (e.g., Sentry)

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Profile page loads in under 1 second
- [ ] No manual refresh calls needed anywhere in the app
- [ ] Real-time updates work for all user actions
- [ ] Image uploads complete in under 5 seconds
- [ ] App initialization completes in under 2 seconds
- [ ] No more timeout errors during data loading
